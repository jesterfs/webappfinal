Title: Franklin Jester Portfolio
Author: Franklin Jester
Class: MET CS 601

This is a basic portfolio site showcasing my mastery of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
The pages are navigable by the arrow keys.

How I have gone above and beyond:
The website is fully responsive, using flexbox and CSS Media Queries.
I did the entire project in Vue instead of just specific pages.
I utilizezed ES6 to make a much more engaging and easy to use website.
